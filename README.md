# Apache Ratis Thirdparty

All bundled thirdparty dependencies are centralized in the *ozone-thirdparty* module.
These modules are located in a separated repository (https://github.com/apache/ozone-thirdparty)
but not attached to the core Apache Ratis repository (https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=ozone.git)
as they only need to change when one of these dependencies are changed.
